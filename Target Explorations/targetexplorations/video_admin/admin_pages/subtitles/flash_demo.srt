1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,838
To understand what I'm about to tell you,

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,806
you need to do something first.

3
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:10,009
You need to believe in the impossible.

4
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:11,844
Can you do that? Good.

5
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,178
You see that red blur?

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,047
That's me.

7
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:17,049
That too.

8
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:20,986
There I am again.

9
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,855
My name is Barry Allen.

10
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,823
I am the fastest man alive.

11
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,796
My story is pretty simple.

12
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:32,831
My whole life, I have been running.

13
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,199
Usually from bullies.

14
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,769
Sometimes I escaped.

15
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:38,937
Sometimes I did not.

16
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,606
Tell me what happened.

17
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:42,541
Those guys were picking on kids

18
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,010
just 'cause they thought they weren't cool.

19
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:47,312
- It wasn't right.
- I know.

20
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,481
- I guess I wasn't fast enough.
- No.

21
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,217
You have such a good heart, Barry.

22
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,320
And it's better to have
a good heart than fast legs.

23
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:57,623
Hello. I'm home.

24
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:00,025
- Barry got into a fight.
- Oh, yeah?

25
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,093
And he won.

26
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:04,263
Ah, way to go, slugger.

27
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:07,666
Oh, and uh, no more fighting.

28
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:08,700
Mm-mm.

29
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,785
But after that night,

30
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:29,054
I was running from something much scarier.

31
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,423
- Something I could never explain.
- Henry! Henry!

32
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,359
Something impossible.

33
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,361
Help!

34
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,764
- Mom! Mom!
- Barry, don't!

35
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,400
- Mom!
- Don't let him touch you!

36
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:43,769
Mom!

37
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,437
Mom!

38
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,673
- Nora!
- Stay back!

39
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:50,109
Nora, hold on!

40
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:54,113
Run, Barry, run!

41
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,014
Mom?

42
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,850
Dad?

43
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:12,898
Sorry.

44
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,666
Second robbery this week.

45
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,835
The teller I.D.'d Clyde
Mardon as the shooter.

46
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,270
What?

47
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:20,005
Oh, jeez, the Mardon Brothers are back?

48
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,673
What do we got?

49
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,475
Perps took the bank, shot out the cameras,

50
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,011
and as a chaser, killed
the security guard over there.

51
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,513
I've got unis kicking in doors

52
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:29,014
of known Mardon Brothers associates.

53
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,016
CSI been over it?

54
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,918
Uh, no.

55
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,621
Where's Allen?

56
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:39,124
Sorry, sorry.

57
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:40,759
You can't keep covering for him.

58
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,628
- CSI, CSI coming through.
- If he's not here now,

59
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,996
I'm gonna have to carry on this
investigation without him.

60
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,330
Sorry I'm late, Captain Singh.

61
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,999
What was it this time, Mr. Allen?

62
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,467
Did you forget to set your alarm clock?

63
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,002
Before you answer, I should remind you

64
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,104
the excuse you gave last time
was car trouble.

65
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:53,672
Want to know why that one
was particularly memorable?

66
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,274
I do not own a car.

67
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:56,842
He was running an errand for me.

68
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:01,346
Barry, did you get me what I asked for?

69
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,148
Yeah, yeah. I did.

70
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,885
I have it right...

71
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,521
Here.

72
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,657
I had a few bites of it.

73
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,044
Getaway car's a mustang shelby gt500.

74
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:34,479
Shelby's have a rear super-wide tire

75
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,981
specific to that model.

76
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:39,218
12 inches with an asymmetrical tread.

77
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,321
And there's something else.

78
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:43,989
Thanks.

79
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,995
Fecal excrement.

80
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:51,663
Animal, I'd guess.

81
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:54,166
My dad gave me that pen...

82
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,902
Before he died.

83
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,570
Sorry.

84
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:13,485
Okay, I am ready to see
this atom smasher smashing.

85
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,587
There was a shooting today.

86
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,756
Your dad needs me to process some evidence,

87
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,191
which means I don't know if we're going

88
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:20,892
to be able to make it to S.T.A.R. Labs.

89
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,262
But seeing this thing turn on
is like your dream.

90
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,197
Your sad, little nerdy dream.

91
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,565
Besides, I canceled a date for this.

92
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:29,201
Hands off my fries.

93
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,736
Unbelievable.

94
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:33,438
I'm stress eating over my dissertation.

95
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,107
We started selling cronuts at Jitters.

96
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,142
I ate two today. If I don't graduate soon,

97
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,578
I'm gonna be more muffin top than woman.

98
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,946
You look amazing.

99
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,817
What is so important

100
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,253
about this particle accelerator anyway?

101
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,722
Harrison Wells' work in quantum theory

102
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,724
is light-years ahead of anything
they're doing at Cern.

103
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:56,128
You're doing that thing where
you're not speaking English.

104
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,863
Okay.

105
00:04:57,865 --> 00:05:00,599
Just imagine

106
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:04,469
that that dot is everything the human race

107
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,305
has ever learned until this moment.

108
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:07,639
Does that include "twerking"?

109
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,541
That is everything we could learn

110
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,143
from the particle accelerator.

111
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,944
It's a whole new way of looking at physics.

112
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,313
It will literally change the way

113
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,648
that we think about everything.

114
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,550
You got to get yourself a girlfriend.

115
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,385
Hey, leave him alone. He's working.

116
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:22,487
Hi, dad.

117
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:26,325
- Your test thingy is done.
- Yeah.

118
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,627
I think the Mardon Brothers
are hiding on a farm.

119
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:31,463
The fecal matter I found on
the street, it was cow manure,

120
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:34,099
which contained traces of oxytetracycline.

121
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,600
It's an antibiotic.

122
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,336
There are only four farms in the area

123
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,471
that still use it in their feed.

124
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:42,674
Bet you find a really sweet
shelby parked at one of them.

125
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,810
Dad, seeing as how Barry
solved your poop problem,

126
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:48,280
how about letting him go to S.T.A.R. Labs?

127
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:52,050
- Fine, go.
- Yes!

128
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,052
Thank you, Joe.

129
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,861
So, Barry, how was your trip?

130
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,831
Did you find proof of the
impossible in Starling City,

131
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:10,202
or did you just make my dad
mad for no reason?

132
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,204
Actually, while I was away,

133
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:15,073
I had a chance to think about...

134
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,842
You know, relationships.

135
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,578
And, well, I'm not in one.

136
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,948
And you're not in one, either.

137
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,117
And you're my best friend, Iris.

138
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,852
You're mine too.

139
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,320
Why else would I be here?

140
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,155
That's not what I meant. What I...

141
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,189
I know what you're gonna say, Barry.

142
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,557
I'm not sure you do.

143
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,092
Even though we pretty much grew up

144
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,694
in the same house together,

145
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:38,697
and we're kind of like brother and sister,

146
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,232
because we're not brother and sister,

147
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,768
it can get really weird and awkward

148
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,869
to talk to me about girls.

149
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,170
But I just want you to know

150
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,205
that it shouldn't be awkward.

151
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,673
There is nothing that I want more

152
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,041
than for you to meet the right person

153
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,344
that totally loves and adores you

154
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:55,847
for the amazing guy that you are.

155
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,451
Took the words right out of my mouth.

156
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,453
Aw, aren't you glad I know you so well?

157
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,497
Thank you.

158
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,933
My name is Harrison Wells.

159
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:18,236
Tonight, the future begins.

160
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:21,006
The work my team and I will do here

161
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,308
will change our understanding of physics.

162
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,944
We'll bring about advancements in power,

163
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,979
advancements in medicine,

164
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,514
and trust me, that future

165
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,616
will be here faster than you think.

166
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,788
Oh, hey, my laptop!
It's got my dissertation.

167
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,964
I'm sorry.

168
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,345
All right, kid, you don't have
to do this, all right?

169
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,746
Just give me back my friend's bag,

170
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,049
and we'll call it even.

171
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,684
Okay?

172
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,121
Barry!

173
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:14,025
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

174
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,393
Freeze! Police!

175
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:16,828
Or do you want to find out the hard way

176
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,398
you're not faster than a bullet?

177
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,837
Who is that guy,
and what is he so proud of?

178
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,172
So he caught a mugger?

179
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,040
He's a transfer from keystone.

180
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,376
Started a few weeks ago. Eddie Thawne.

181
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:35,514
Oh, that's Detective Pretty Boy.

182
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,849
That's what my dad calls him.

183
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,520
Says he actually keeps score
when it comes to arrests.

184
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,388
He is pretty though.

185
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,563
This is the last farm on Barry's list.

186
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:52,864
Look, I know the kid's smart,

187
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,299
but you said it yourself.

188
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:57,202
Sometimes he's chasing flying pigs.

189
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,371
Well, let's check it out anyway.

190
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,284
I'm Linda park, and we're live
outside S.T.A.R. Labs

191
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:13,618
despite the inclement weather,

192
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,086
which is only going to get worse.

193
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,055
The torrential downpour
has in no way affected

194
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,356
the particle accelerator,

195
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,058
which is up and running smoothly

196
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,561
according to S.T.A.R.
Labs CEO Harrison Wells.

197
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:26,398
The weather has also...

198
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,795
- Whoa.
- Mardon.

199
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:59,297
Ah!

200
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,872
I've got a plane to catch!

201
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,280
What the hell?

202
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,648
Ah!

203
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,189
Chyre, hang in there.

204
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:35,066
Wait, we're now being told
to evacuate the facility.

205
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,735
The storm may have caused a malfunction

206
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:38,536
to the primary cooling system.

207
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,071
Officials are now trying to shut down

208
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,873
the particle accelerator, but so far,

209
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,643
have been unable to regain
control of the system...

210
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,028
What the hell happened to him?

211
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,030
He was hit by lightning.

212
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,265
How is he still alive?

213
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,866
Go.

214
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,768
No heartbeat. CBC, chem 24,
type and cross four.

215
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,203
- Bag him.
- He's coding.

216
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,205
- You can't be in here.
- I'm family.

217
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,773
- Charge the paddles to 200.
- Barry!

218
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,975
Clear.

219
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,293
What are you doing?

220
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:09,494
He likes this song.

221
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,229
How could you possibly know that?

222
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,931
I checked his Facebook page.

223
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,433
I mean, he can hear everything, right?

224
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,634
Auditory functions are the last

225
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:18,837
sensory faculties to degenerate.

226
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,973
♪ Can't read my no
he can't read my poker... ♪

227
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,975
Oh, my God!

228
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,844
- Where am I?
- He's up.

229
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:28,413
Dr. Wells, get down
to the cortex, like, right now.

230
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,616
Pulse 120, pupils equally
reactive to light.

231
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,819
Look at me, look at me.
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, relax.

232
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,121
Everything's okay, man.

233
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:37,722
You're at S.T.A.R. Labs.

234
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,491
S.T.A.R. Labs? Who are you?

235
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:42,660
I'm cisco Ramon. She's Caitlin... Dr. Snow.

236
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,162
I need you to urinate in this.

237
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:45,764
Not this second.

238
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,732
What is... what is happening?
What is going on?

239
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:50,602
You were struck by lightning, dude.

240
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,772
What?

241
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,840
Lightning gave me abs?

242
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,242
Your muscles should be atrophied,

243
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,810
but instead they're in a chronic

244
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,845
and unexplained state
of cellular regeneration.

245
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:03,548
Come here. Have a seat.

246
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,916
You were in a coma.

247
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,718
For how long?

248
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,020
Nine months.

249
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:12,323
Welcome back, Mr. Allen.

250
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:15,860
We have a lot to discuss.

251
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,662
It's hard to believe I'm here.

252
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,031
I have always wanted
to meet you face to face.

253
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,633
Yeah?

254
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,201
Well, you certainly went to
great lengths to do it.

255
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,804
S.T.A.R. Labs has not been operational

256
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,372
since FEMA categorized us

257
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:31,009
as a class four hazardous location.

258
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,811
17 people died that night.

259
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,345
Many more were injured.

260
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,915
Myself amongst them.

261
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,050
Jeez.

262
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,820
What happened?

263
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,455
Nine months ago, the particle accelerator

264
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,491
went online exactly as planned.

265
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,727
For 45 minutes, I had
achieved my life's dream.

266
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:53,298
And then... Then there was an anomaly.

267
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,733
The electron volts became unmeasurable,

268
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,335
the ring under us popped.

269
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,571
Energy from that detonation
was thrown into the sky

270
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:01,973
and that, in turn, seeded a storm cloud...

271
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,209
That created a lightning bolt

272
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:06,277
that struck me.

273
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:09,380
That's right.

274
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:13,518
I was recovering myself...

275
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,688
When I heard about you.

276
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,757
The hospital was undergoing
unexplainable power outages

277
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,026
every time you were going
into cardiac arrest,

278
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,229
which was actually a misdiagnosis

279
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:27,565
because you see,
you weren't flatlining, Barry.

280
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,901
Your heartbeat was moving too fast

281
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:32,270
for the EKG to register it.

282
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:35,874
Now, I'm not the most popular
person in town these days,

283
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,443
but Detective West and his daughter

284
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:39,811
gave me permission to bring you here,

285
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:42,146
where we were able to stabilize you.

286
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,481
- Iris?
- Iris, yes.

287
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,450
She came to see you quite often.

288
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,784
She talks a lot.

289
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:48,253
Also, she's hot.

290
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,054
- I need to go.
- No, you can't.

291
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,856
No, no. No, Caitlin's right.

292
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,291
No, now that you're awake,
we need to do more tests.

293
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,293
You're still going through changes.

294
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,694
There's so much that we don't know.

295
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,030
I'm fine. Really, I feel normal.

296
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:00,965
Thank you for saving my life.

297
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,167
Really?

298
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,936
Can I keep the sweatshirt?

299
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:07,205
- Yeah, keep the sweatshirt.
- Okay.

300
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:17,115
Sure.

301
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:22,020
- Fill 'er up?
- Thanks.

302
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,796
Oh, my God.

303
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,335
You're awake.

304
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,836
Why didn't S.T.A.R. Labs call us?

305
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,305
I just woke up.

306
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:41,973
Should you even be on your feet?

307
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,509
Iris, I... I'm okay.

308
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,613
I watched you die, Barry.

309
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,949
You kept dying. Your heart kept stopping.

310
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,120
It's still beating.

311
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,457
- Feels really fast.
- Oops.

312
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:06,731
Are you okay, Tracy?

313
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:10,535
Yeah, I got it.

314
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:13,838
My dad is gonna be so happy to see you.

315
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,274
Let me get my stuff, okay? Be right back.

316
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,651
Thank you. Thank you so much.

317
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:30,521
How can I help you today?

318
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,890
"This is a robbery."

319
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:33,992
Is this supposed to be a joke?

320
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,494
You tell me.

321
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:51,542
Oh, you scared the hell out of us, kid.

322
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,945
Yeah, that was quite the nap
you took there, baby face,

323
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:56,347
and you still look 12.

324
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,016
You look okay.

325
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,584
Are you really?

326
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:01,486
- Yeah.
- Detective West,

327
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:04,789
we've got a 5.15 in progress
at gold city bank, two dead.

328
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,457
Storm's really picking up
on the South side.

329
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,825
I'd grab your rain gear.

330
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,460
I'm sorry, Barry. I got to run.

331
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,429
- Do you need my help?
- No, you take it easy.

332
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,431
There'll be plenty for you to do
once you settle in.

333
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,300
Let's go, partner.

334
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:19,504
Hey, Allen. Glad to see you.

335
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,839
- Thanks, Eddie.
- Hey, Iris.

336
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,341
Detective, you should go.

337
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:26,277
My dad doesn't like to be kept waiting.

338
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,513
Glad you're back.

339
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,987
The night of the explosion,

340
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:37,889
Clyde Mardon shot and killed Chyre.

341
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,624
Mardon and his brother
died trying to escape.

342
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:40,958
Their plane crashed.

343
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,760
Iris, got a minute?

344
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,495
Hey, Barry. Good to see you.

345
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,770
Screw you!

346
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,472
You okay?

347
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,274
I... I'm fine.

348
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:57,675
I... I just need some air.

349
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,744
But I'll call you tonight, all right?

350
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,488
What's happening to me?

351
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:20,131
Oh, oh!

352
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,192
Awesome.

353
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,767
You don't really believe he
can run that fast, do you?

354
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,069
Well, I believe anything is possible,

355
00:18:58,071 --> 00:18:59,237
and in a few minutes,

356
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:02,306
maybe you will too.

357
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,575
How does it fit?

358
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,815
It's a little snug.

359
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,250
At least you will be moving so fast

360
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:15,319
no one will see you.

361
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,788
See, you thought the
world was slowing down.

362
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,056
It wasn't.

363
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,625
You were moving so fast

364
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:23,427
it only looked like everyone
else was standing still.

365
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,463
Dr. Wells will be monitoring
your energy output,

366
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,765
and Caitlin, your vitals.

367
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,100
What do you do?

368
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:32,403
I make the toys, my man. Check it.

369
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:35,106
This is a two-way headset
with a camera I modified.

370
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:37,175
Typically designed to combat
battlefield impulse noise,

371
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,977
or in your case, potential sonic booms,

372
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:43,114
which would be awesome.

373
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:52,256
- What?
- Nothing.

374
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:55,660
I just noticed you don't smile too much.

375
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:59,163
My once promising career
in bioengineering is over,

376
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:00,598
my boss is in a wheelchair for life,

377
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,333
the explosion that put you in a coma

378
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:05,169
also killed my fiance.

379
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:09,840
So this blank expression kind of
feels like the way to go.

380
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:12,276
Mr. Allen, while I am extremely eager

381
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:15,246
to determine your full range of abilities,

382
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:18,282
I do caution restraint.

383
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,117
Yeah.

384
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,783
Woo-hoo!

385
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,485
He just passed 200 Miles per hour.

386
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,423
It's not possible.

387
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,899
Mom!

388
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,302
- No, Barry!
- Mom!

389
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,738
No! Don't let him touch you!

390
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,708
Aah!

391
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,323
What is all this?

392
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,625
Witnesses from the robbery
at Gold City Bank.

393
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,527
Perp made off with 200 grand, more or less.

394
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:39,163
- Catch these guys.
- The windows blew in.

395
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:41,632
It was like a hurricane.

396
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,367
Everyone ran for cover.

397
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,036
We're going to have
a sketch artist work with you,

398
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:49,073
if you feel up to it.

399
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:50,574
Third robbery in a month

400
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,243
where a freak storm precedes it.

401
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:54,178
Sounds like one of those
"wide world of weird" cases

402
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,813
- Barry's obsessed with.
- He's not obsessed.

403
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,081
Guess you haven't read his blog.

404
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,949
The security cameras at the bank.

405
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,718
Apparently it all shorted out.

406
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,087
We got a bunch of witnesses here.

407
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:04,955
They all have cell phones.

408
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:07,391
The sky went black and then, boom.

409
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:09,460
Outside was inside.

410
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:11,095
Man, it was like there was a thunderstorm

411
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:12,563
in the bank.

412
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:15,299
Vukuvich, suspect is driving
a black Mustang.

413
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:18,369
Partial plate six-kilo-Charlie-three.

414
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,937
- Put out an APB.
- Copy that.

415
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:25,943
It looks like you had
a distal radius fracture.

416
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:28,379
Had?

417
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:30,414
It's healed... In three hours.

418
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:33,084
How is that even possible?

419
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:35,920
We don't know... yet.

420
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:38,356
You really need to learn how to stop.

421
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:39,757
What happened out there today?

422
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,258
You were moving pretty well,

423
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,363
and then something
caused you to lose focus.

424
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,598
I started remembering something.

425
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,606
When I was 11, my mother was murdered.

426
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,613
It was late.

427
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,148
A sound woke me up.

428
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:08,986
I came downstairs and...

429
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:12,523
I saw what looked like a ball of lightning.

430
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:15,259
Inside the lightning,

431
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:18,629
there was a man.

432
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:22,199
He killed my mom.

433
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,368
They arrested my dad.

434
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:28,105
He's still sitting
in Iron Heights for her murder.

435
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:30,541
Everyone, the cops, the shrinks,

436
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:33,210
they all told me what I saw was impossible.

437
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,682
But what if the man who killed my mom

438
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,418
was like me?

439
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,287
Well, I think I can say unequivocally

440
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,923
you are one of a kind.

441
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,330
Can I help you, detective?

442
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:55,199
You can stop acting like you can't stand me

443
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:56,667
when your dad's around.

444
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,436
Aww.

445
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:02,273
And I like having a boyfriend
who isn't shot to death.

446
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,557
You can't tell my dad.

447
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,492
He doesn't know about me and Eddie.

448
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:23,561
Doesn't seem like anyone's
in on the secret.

449
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:25,729
I was gonna tell you.

450
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:27,064
When you were in the hospital,

451
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,499
Eddie covered my father's shifts

452
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:30,534
so that we could both be with you.

453
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:32,102
I thanked him with a cup of coffee,

454
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:36,173
and things just kind of happened.

455
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:39,376
And it's good.

456
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:40,845
Dating your partner's daughter...

457
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:43,247
Isn't that against department regulations?

458
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:45,082
Why are you so upset?

459
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:47,251
I just don't like having
to lie to your dad, you know?

460
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,931
Barry?

461
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,458
Hey! Mardon!

462
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,440
That poor man.

463
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:17,775
The way that fog came in,

464
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:19,543
I have never seen anything like it.

465
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:21,645
Barry! Iris.

466
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:23,881
I'm all right, dad.

467
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:25,149
What the hell were you thinking

468
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:26,517
- having her out here?
- No, no, no...

469
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,152
And I told you, when you see danger,

470
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:29,987
you run the other way. You're not a cop.

471
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:31,522
- Because you wouldn't let me.
- You're damn right.

472
00:26:31,524 --> 00:26:32,623
Joe, I need to talk to you.

473
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:37,595
- It can wait.
- No, now.

474
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:39,597
I know who did this.

475
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,799
It's Clyde Mardon.

476
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:43,834
I know everybody thinks
he died in a plane crash

477
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:45,035
after the S.T.A.R. Labs explosion,

478
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:47,671
but he is alive.

479
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:49,106
All right, something
happened to him that night.

480
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:54,545
I... I think he can control the weather.

481
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:56,614
The recent robberies,
they all happened during

482
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:58,315
freak meteorological events.

483
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,517
And when I just confronted Mardon,

484
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:05,155
the street was instantly enveloped in fog.

485
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:08,058
Of course you don't believe me.

486
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,561
- You never believe me.
- Okay.

487
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:11,829
You want to do this now?

488
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,430
Out here? Fine.

489
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:15,733
Mardon is dead.

490
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,901
There is no controlling the weather, Barry.

491
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,503
Just like there was no lightning storm

492
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,038
in your house that night.

493
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,073
It was your brain
helping a scared little boy

494
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,274
accept what he saw.

495
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:25,909
My dad did not murder my mother.

496
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,678
Yes, he did! Your dad killed
your mother, Barry!

497
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,513
I am sorry, son!

498
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:31,048
But I knew it, the jury knew it,

499
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,249
and now he's paying for what he did.

500
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,018
- Dad, enough!
- Unh-uh, Iris.

501
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,419
I have done my best to take care of you

502
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:36,887
since that night, and I have never asked

503
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,589
for anything in return,
not even a thank you,

504
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:41,191
but what I do ask now is that you

505
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:44,595
for once in your life
see things as they are.

506
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,073
You're not going to believe this.

507
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:57,341
We got the eyewitness sketch

508
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,743
of the robber from the bank job.

509
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:03,747
If I didn't know better,
I'd say that's Clyde Mardon.

510
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,549
But that's impossible.

511
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:08,385
He's dead, right?

512
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:09,920
I wasn't the only one affected

513
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:14,958
by the particle accelerator
explosion, was I?

514
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,160
We don't know for sure.

515
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:17,461
You said the city was safe,

516
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:19,730
that there was no residual danger.

517
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:24,301
But that's not true, so what
really happened that night?

518
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:25,936
Well...

519
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:27,805
The accelerator went active.

520
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:31,608
We all felt like heroes, and then...

521
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,843
It all went wrong.

522
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:34,745
The dimensional barrier ruptured,

523
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:37,181
unleashing unknown energies into our world.

524
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:38,749
Antimatter, dark energy, x-elements...

525
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:40,117
Those are all theoretical.

526
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,119
And how theoretical are you?

527
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,622
We mapped the dispersion

528
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:46,924
throughout and around Central City.

529
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:48,125
Though we have no way of knowing

530
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:50,728
exactly what or... Who was exposed,

531
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,763
we've been searching for other

532
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:55,766
- meta-humans like yourself.
- "Meta-humans"?

533
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:57,735
That's what we're calling them.

534
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,403
I saw one today.

535
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,672
He's a bank robber, and he
can control the weather.

536
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:03,640
This just keeps getting cooler.

537
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:05,476
This is not cool.

538
00:29:05,478 --> 00:29:07,745
All right? A man died.

539
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:10,814
Mardon must have gotten his
powers the same way I did.

540
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:12,216
From the storm cloud.

541
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:14,284
He's still out there.

542
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,487
We have to stop him
before he hurts anyone else.

543
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:18,322
Barry!

544
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:19,556
That's a job for the police.

545
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:20,858
I work for the police.

546
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,193
As a forensic assistant.

547
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:24,695
You're responsible for this.

548
00:29:24,697 --> 00:29:25,796
For him.

549
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:28,732
What's important is you!

550
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:31,401
Not me. I lost everything.

551
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,003
I lost my company.

552
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:34,538
I lost my reputation.

553
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,540
I lost my freedom.

554
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,575
And then you broke your arm,

555
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,744
and it healed in three hours.

556
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:43,347
Inside your body could be a map

557
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:46,216
to a whole new world... Genetic therapies,

558
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:49,353
vaccines, medicines, treasures buried deep

559
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:52,689
within your cells and we cannot
risk losing everything

560
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:56,560
because you want to go out and play hero!

561
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:59,663
You're not a hero.

562
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:02,032
You are just a young man
who was struck by lightning.

563
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,353
I didn't do this.

564
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:25,055
I swear to God, I didn't do this.

565
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,690
Dad, why are they taking you?

566
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:28,559
- Barry, don't go in the house.
- Where's mom?

567
00:30:28,561 --> 00:30:29,560
What's gonna happen to my son?

568
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:30,994
- Dad!
- Barry!

569
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,864
- Dad!
- Stay out of the house!

570
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:38,235
Barry!

571
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:40,170
Joe, you know these people?

572
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,639
My daughter's best friends with their kid.

573
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:45,342
- I'm sorry.
- Mm.

574
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:56,220
- Mom.
- Barry.

575
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:57,721
Mom!

576
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,936
So that's my story.

577
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:15,973
I've spent my whole life
searching for the impossible,

578
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:19,910
never imagining that I would

579
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:22,646
become the impossible.

580
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,053
So why come to me?

581
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,289
Something tells me you
didn't just run 600 Miles

582
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,224
to say "hi" to a friend.

583
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:39,229
All my life, I've wanted to just do more...

584
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,031
Be more.

585
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:42,466
And now I am.

586
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:45,135
And the first chance I get to help someone,

587
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:47,871
I screw up.

588
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:49,706
What if Wells is right?

589
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,475
What if I'm not a hero?

590
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:53,810
What if I'm just some guy
who was struck by lightning?

591
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:55,445
I don't think that bolt of lightning

592
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:58,048
struck you, Barry.

593
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:02,319
I think it chose you.

594
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:05,489
I'm just not sure I'm like you, Oliver.

595
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:08,625
I don't know if I can be some... vigilante.

596
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:12,663
You can be better.

597
00:32:12,665 --> 00:32:16,633
Because you can inspire people

598
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:19,770
in a way that I never could...

599
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:22,172
Watching over your city
like a guardian angel...

600
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:25,943
Making a difference...

601
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:28,946
Saving people...

602
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:31,882
In a flash.

603
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,854
Take your own advice.

604
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,856
Wear a mask.

605
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:47,965
Cool.

606
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,670
Cool.

607
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:01,211
I've been going over unsolved cases

608
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:02,512
from the past nine months,

609
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:03,981
and there's been a sharp increase

610
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:06,383
in unexplained deaths and missing people.

611
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:07,851
Your meta-humans have been busy.

612
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:09,519
Now, I'm not blaming you.

613
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,822
I know you didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

614
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:14,091
I know you all lost something.

615
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:15,559
But I need your help to catch Mardon

616
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:17,561
and anyone else out there like him.

617
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:18,996
But I can't do it without you.

618
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,436
If we're gonna do this,

619
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:28,672
I have something that might help.

620
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,508
Something I've been playing with.

621
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,876
Designed to replace the turnouts

622
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:35,012
firefighters traditionally wear.

623
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:36,780
I thought if S.T.A.R. Labs
could do something nice

624
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:38,215
for the community, maybe people wouldn't

625
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:40,183
be so angry at Dr. Wells anymore.

626
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,185
How is it going to help me?

627
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,754
It's made of a reinforced tri-polymer.

628
00:33:43,756 --> 00:33:45,589
It's heat and abrasive resistant,

629
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,057
so it should withstand your moving

630
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,392
at high-velocity speeds.

631
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:49,726
And the aerodynamic design

632
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:51,094
should help you maintain control.

633
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:52,562
Plus, it has built-in sensors

634
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:54,031
so we can track your vitals

635
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,499
and stay in contact with you from here.

636
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:56,867
Thanks.

637
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:58,502
Now how do we find Mardon?

638
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:00,437
I retasked S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

639
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:02,139
to track meteorological abnormalities

640
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:03,273
over Central City.

641
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,674
We just got a ping.

642
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,610
Atmospheric pressure dropped 20 millibars

643
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:08,645
in a matter of seconds.

644
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:11,581
I've tracked it to a farm
just west of the city.

645
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,752
I'm not saying Mardon is alive.

646
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,254
But if he was, this is the last place

647
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:18,588
him and his brother hid out.

648
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,090
Let's go.

649
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,103
Mardon?

650
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:34,738
On your feet.

651
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,239
Hands on your head.

652
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,075
You got me.

653
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:44,448
The night of the storm,
after S.T.A.R. Labs blew,

654
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,249
after our plane went down,

655
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,085
and I woke up on the ground alive,

656
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:53,290
when I saw what I can do, I understood.

657
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:54,458
I am God.

658
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,594
Shut the hell up.

659
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,496
Turn around.

660
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,373
Do you think that your guns can stop God?

661
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:13,977
Why in the hell would God
need to rob banks?

662
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:15,979
You're right.

663
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:18,849
I've been thinking too small.

664
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,653
Barry! Barry!

665
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,288
This thing's getting closer.

666
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,690
Wind speeds are 200
Miles-per-hour and increasing.

667
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:01,758
Barry, can you hear me?

668
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,627
Yeah. Loud and clear.

669
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:08,031
If it keeps up, this could
become an F-5 tornado.

670
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,199
But it's headed towards the city.

671
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:11,968
How do I stop it? Guys?

672
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:16,740
What if I unravel it?

673
00:36:16,742 --> 00:36:18,375
How the hell are you going to do that?

674
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:20,277
I'll run around it
in the opposite direction,

675
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:22,045
cut off its legs.

676
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:23,780
He'd have to clock
700 Miles-per-hour to do that.

677
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:25,849
Your body may not
be able to handle those speeds.

678
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,384
You'll die.

679
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:30,220
I have to try.

680
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:43,066
The suit's holding up.

681
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:44,868
- But he's not.
- He can do it.

682
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,870
I know he can do it.

683
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,088
It's too strong!

684
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,958
It's time to think big.

685
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,865
You can do this, Barry.

686
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:17,000
You were right.

687
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:19,369
I am responsible for all of this.

688
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:21,338
So many people have been hurt

689
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,939
because of me, and when I looked at you,

690
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:25,976
all I saw was another potential
victim of my hubris.

691
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:27,544
And yes, I created this madness,

692
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:30,814
but you, Barry, you can stop it.

693
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:33,183
You can do this.

694
00:37:33,185 --> 00:37:36,319
Now run, Barry, run!

695
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,034
Barry?

696
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,339
Hey.

697
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:36,246
I didn't think there was
anyone else like me.

698
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:38,348
I'm not like you.

699
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:41,685
You're a murderer.

700
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,890
- Barry?
- It's over.

701
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:49,392
I'm okay.

702
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:25,261
What you can do...

703
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:28,465
It was the lightning bolt?

704
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:31,735
More or less.

705
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:34,804
I'm sorry, Barry.

706
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:38,041
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

707
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:42,612
And I called you crazy
for chasing the impossible.

708
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:43,913
But you really did see something

709
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:45,081
that night your mom died.

710
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,719
And your dad is innocent.

711
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,091
I need you to promise me something.

712
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:57,093
I don't want you telling Iris

713
00:39:57,095 --> 00:40:00,296
about anything you can do, any of it.

714
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:02,132
I want her safe.

715
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:05,201
Promise me.

716
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:07,604
Yeah.

717
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:28,758
Hey, slugger.

718
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,960
You've been calling me that since I was 11.

719
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:34,364
Funny thing is, I finally got

720
00:40:34,366 --> 00:40:35,765
into a fight today.

721
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,367
You just got out of a coma.

722
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:41,871
I'm not sure you should be picking fights.

723
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:44,140
Hey...

724
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:46,976
Did you win?

725
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:49,212
Yeah, I did.

726
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:59,789
You didn't kill mom.

727
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:03,626
You know I know that, right?

728
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:07,530
You believing me is all I need.

729
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,337
You're not gonna be in here much longer.

730
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,506
Whoever killed mom...

731
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:20,176
Whatever killed her...

732
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:22,445
I think I finally have a way to find them.

733
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:23,780
To stop them.

734
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:27,450
Barry, we've talked about this.

735
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:28,985
It's time to let it go.

736
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:33,523
You have got to stop worrying about me,

737
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:34,991
and live your life.

738
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:41,998
For the first time,
I feel like I finally can.

739
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,336
The truth is,
ever since the night mom died,

740
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:48,805
I've been stuck in one place,

741
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:52,308
missed out on a lot of things.

742
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,010
But I'm different now.

743
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,312
I've made some new friends.

744
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:58,014
They're helping me find my way...

745
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,283
Why is it shaped like a lightning bolt?

746
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:02,352
So it's not boring.

747
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,087
To finally move forward.

748
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:07,023
You remember when you
wanted me to change my name

749
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:11,761
so I wouldn't have to deal with
people knowing you're my dad?

750
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:15,098
I'm glad they know.

751
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:22,438
I'm so proud to be your son.

752
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:31,481
I love you, son.

753
00:42:31,483 --> 00:42:35,518
I love you too, dad.

754
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,734
My name is Barry Allen,

755
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,771
and I am the fastest man alive.

756
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,276
A friend recently gave me

757
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:01,978
the idea for a new name.

758
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,752
And something tells me,
it's gonna catch on.

759
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,463
Greg, move your head!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
